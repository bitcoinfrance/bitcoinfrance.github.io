<p>In January of 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto released the first widely used implementation of peer- to-peer trustless electronic cash[Nak09], replacing the central server’s signature with a consensus mechanism based on proof of work[Bac02], with economic incentives to act cooperatively. Bitcoin tracks payments by aggregating them into blocks, each with an associated blockheader, which cryptographically commits1 to: the contents of the block, a timestamp, and the previous blockheader. The commitments to previous headers form a blockchain, or chain, which provides a well-defined ordering for transactions.</p>
<p>Bitcoin’s blockheaders can be regarded as an example of a dynamic-membership multi-party signature (or DMMS), which we consider to be of independent interest as a new type of group signature. Bitcoin provides the first embodiment of such a signature, although this has not appeared in the literature until now. A DMMS is a digital signature formed by a set of signers which has no fixed size. Bitcoin’s blockheaders are DMMSes because their proof-of-work has the property that anyone can contribute with no <strong>enrolment process</strong>. Further, contribution is weighted by computational power rather than one threshold signature contribution per party, which allows anonymous membership <strong>without risk of a Sybil attack</strong> (when one party joins many times and has disproportionate input into the signature). For this reason, the DMMS has also been described<br />
as a solution to the Byzantine Generals Problem.</p>
<p>Because the blocks are chained together, Bitcoin’s DMMS is cumulative: any chain (or chain fragment) of blockheaders is also a DMMS on its first block, with computational strength equal to the sum of the strengths of the DMMSes it is composed of. Nakamoto’s key innovation is the aforementioned use of a DMMS as a signature of computational power rather than a signature of knowledge. Because signers prove computational work, rather than proving secret knowledge as is typical for digital signatures, we refer to them as miners. To achieve stable consensus on the blockchain history, economic incentives are provided where miners are rewarded with fees and subsidies in the form of coins that are valuable only if the miners form a shared valid history, incentivising them to behave honestly.</p>
<p>Because the strength of Bitcoin’s cumulative DMMS is directly proportional to the total computational power contributed by all miners[Poe14a], it becomes infeasible for a computational minority to change the chain. If they try to revise the DMMS-secured ledger, they will fall behind and be continually unable to catch up to the moving target of the progressing consensus blockchain.</p>
<p>A commitment is a cryptographic object which is computed from some secret data, but does not reveal it, such that the data cannot be changed after the fact. An example of a commitment is a hash: given data x, one can publish H(x) where H is a hash function, and only later reveal x. Verifiers can then confirm that the revealed value is the same as the original value by computing H(x) themselves.</p>
<p>Qu'est ce qu'une sidechain apporte par rapport au "merged mining" ?</p>
<p>Lamport signatures</p>
<p>Peter Todd:<br />
My review of the paper is basically the same as before; nothing is in it that I wasn't expecting. (much of the content of the paper has been in public discussion on #bitcoin-wizards for a long time)<br />
I've proposed ideas quite similar to sidechains myself before - I called them Fidelity Bonded Ledgers - and the "rachetting" concept for redeeming funds by find the longest known chain is something gmaxwell and I came up with for fidelity bonded ledgers. I want to stress that 90% of the ideas in sidechains are good ideas, and they've had a lot of peer review. I've been promoting sidechain concepts to my colored coin clients in fact, as they'd be a great way to add auditabillity and shutdown-resistance to the centralized entities that will exist to trade colored coins at high speed and low cost; the smartcolors kernel I'm working on is specifically designed to work well with sidechains and hub-and-spoke micropayment systems.<br />
The idea of a Dynamic Membership Multi-Party Signature (DMMS) is a very clever way of describing Bitcoin's PoW in terms of a cryptographic signature; AFAIK the idea is a novel one. As an academic tool it's a great description, and I think helps make clear the issues with proof-of-stake. But would I create a production financial system using DMMS? No.<br />
The problem is applying the DMMS signature concept to deciding history with 2-way-pegs. Basically doing that means that you have a pot of money - the 2-way-pegged funds - which can be taken by anyone with hashing power to spare. It creates a situation where 51% attacking a sidechain has a strong monetary incentive, one that even grows as more people use the sidechain. (remember this incentive may be due to lost coins too!) Fixes like re-org proofs only delay the inevitable: with sufficient hashing power 51% attackers can steal the pegged funds, and earn a lot of money doing so.<br />
The second issue is that 2-way-pegs are most viable with merge-mining. Without merge-mining, hashing power is split among all the sidechains, leading to the poor security situation we already see in the altcoin market. (do I really need to list all the alts that have been 51% attacked?) Merge-mining is a seductive alternative - let miners secure our chain at no cost to them - but it's equally good at letting attackers attack our chain at no cost. Of course, sidechain promoters will bring up notions of 'opportunity cost' in defence, arguing that attacking the chain is not cost free because the chain can reward miners in some way. But economic rewards aren't universal: if my country doesn't let me mine Zerocash for legal reasons, the value of mining Zerocash to me is zero. If I'm invested in a sidechain that competes with Zerocash - perhaps RingSigCash - the value of mining Zerocash to me may even be negative for helping out the competition. Equally on top of that, I always have the opportunity of stealing 2-way-pegged funds, or at minimum, DoS attacking the competing chain by triggering re-org protection rules until enough miners give up mining it for me to steal the funds.<br />
The third issue is that merge-mining promotes mining centralization. Heck, the sidechain paper says so itself, pointing out that the overhead costs of mining a sidechain make large pools more profitable than small ones, and suggests that perhaps validation could be outsourced to third-parties. For instance Blockstream could act as a central sidechain verification service that mining pools contract with, giving control of the sidechains over to the third-party... Needless to say, this is just hiding that centralization by adding a level of indirection.<br />
Should Bitcoin adopt the soft-fork required to make (merge-)mined 2-way-pegged sidechains possible? Well, Ethereum doesn't have a choice: it's scripting system is sufficiently complete that it already supports the creation of 2-way-pegs. (I'd suggest sidechain devs look into developing the idea there!) Bitcoin may want to support 2-way-pegged sidechains that are signed by (federated) central authorities - but we're going to want to think very, very carefully how we're going to avoid the serious downsides of encouraging more merge-mining.</p>
