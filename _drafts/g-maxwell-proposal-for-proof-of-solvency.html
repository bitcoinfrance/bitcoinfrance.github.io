<p>gmaxwell's prove-how-(non)-fractional-your-Bitcoin-reserves-are scheme.  Very slightly edited and reordered.</p>
<p>Since this idea is getting some attention on HN today (which is especially<br />
welcome in the current climate of exchange mistrust!), some notes/context:</p>
<p> - The TL;DR: As a Bitcoin exchange it's (theoretically) fairly straightforward<br />
   to let individual customers verify that you really hold the Bitcoin funds<br />
   you claim to hold on their behalf.  There might well be practical/security<br />
   considerations when it comes to cold storage though, and the system<br />
   described relies on customers actually bothering to check.</p>
<p> - In the context I heard it, I think this was compared to a trend towards<br />
   provably fair gambling becoming a standard on betting sites.  Wouldn't it be<br />
   great if this became standard to the degree that customers would avoid<br />
   exchanges that didn't offer it?  Consider asking your exchange whether<br />
   they'd do this, and if not, why not.  I've only heard of CoinKite offering<br />
   anything comparable, but I've not looked into it.</p>
<p> - I first heard this from gmaxwell, but patcon on HN has noted Peter Todd also<br />
   described the idea; see <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d3LA8KpdMQ#t=6m45s><br />
   and <https://people.xiph.org/~greg/bitcoin-wizards-fraud-proof.log.txt>.<br />
   I'm not asserting anything about the origin.</p>

<p><gmaxwell>   iwilcox: the idea is simple enough. Two halves. First you show how<br />
             much funds you have via signmessage for actual coins on the chain.<br />
             Thats easy enough.</p>
<p><gmaxwell>   Then you need to prove how much you should have. This is a little<br />
             tricker. You could just publish EVERYONE's balances e.g.  by<br />
             account ID but thats undesirable for privacy and commercial reasons.</p>
<p><gmaxwell>   But I described a way prove how much you should have without doing<br />
             that.</p>
<p><gmaxwell>   Here is how:   Say you have a collection of "nodes",   Each node<br />
             has two fields.  node.value and node.hash.  create a node for<br />
             every account.  E.g. I have 1 BTC, and my accounthash is 0.  so<br />
             value=1 and hash=0.</p>
<p><gmaxwell>   Now I define a NodeCombiner function:<br />
               node NC(left_node, right_node) = {<br />
                    n = new node;<br />
                    n.value = left_node.value + right_node.value;<br />
                    n.hash = sha256(left_node.value + right_node.value || left_node.hash || right_node.hash;<br />
               }</p>
<p><gmaxwell>   you take all your users and arrange them in a binary tree, that<br />
             can have any shape you want.. e.g. a whole bunch of interior<br />
             nodes.. ultimately connecting up to some root node.  And you use<br />
             the NodeCombiner function to fill in the values of all the<br />
             interior nodes up the tree.</p>
<p><cusipzzz>   each user can verify their balance is covered by site owners<br />
             funds, but can't see the total, or # of accounts?</p>
<p><gmaxwell>   This is like the merkel trees used for transactions in bitcoin,<br />
             except there is an additional value sum along with the hashes.</p>
<p><gmaxwell>   The site then publishes the root hash and value widely where<br />
             everyone can see it. ... and when you connect the site gives you<br />
             your account balances and just the interior nodes between you and<br />
             the root so you can verify that your account is included in the<br />
             root but can't tell much about anything else.</p>
<p><gmaxwell>   so it changes the problem from:<br />
                 {prove how much they have, prove how much they should have}<br />
             to:<br />
                 {prove how much they have, _say_ how much they should have,<br />
                     prove that your account was included in that total}</p>
<p><gmaxwell>   one point about this is that it doesn't prevent fractional<br />
             reserve --- but if used well, it prevents *dishonest* fractional<br />
             reserve.</p>
<p><cusipzzz>   and doesn't prevent the site owner from going MIA with the full<br />
             reserve funds :)</p>
<p><iwilcox>    That kind of absconding owner is unlikely to care much for proving<br />
             they don't fractionally-reserve beyond stated fractions.</p>
<p><gmaxwell>   Cusipzzz: indeed, but it can inhibit long cons or prevent them<br />
             from hiding theft.</p>
<p><cusipzzz>   you have to reveal # of accounts? some people would not want to<br />
             reveal nuber of active accounts</p>
<p><gmaxwell>   nope. not that either</gmaxwell></cusipzzz></gmaxwell></iwilcox></cusipzzz></gmaxwell></gmaxwell></gmaxwell></gmaxwell></cusipzzz></gmaxwell></gmaxwell></gmaxwell></gmaxwell></gmaxwell></gmaxwell></p>
