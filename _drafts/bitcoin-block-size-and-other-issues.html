<p>Initial distribution of Bitcoin not enough decentralized ? A case of paradise fallacy (D. Kahneman).</p>
<p>Time value of money:</p>
<p>Amount of loan is created or transferred ?<br />
Is it for consumption or production ?<br />
If it is for consumption, is it sustainable consumption or reckless consumption ?<br />
If it is for consumption, is pricing accurate or distorted by ignoring the value of common goods ?</p>
