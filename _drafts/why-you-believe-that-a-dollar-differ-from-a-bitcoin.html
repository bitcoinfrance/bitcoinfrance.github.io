<p>In this article, I will refrain from using the all-too-common word "cryto-currency", because today there are only digital currencies, functionning with various degrees of centralization.<br />
Most of your day to day payments will go through a bank card processor using many cryptographic primitives and processes, in fact more complex and less transparent than that of any so-called "crypto-currency".<br />
All currencies  are in fact payment networks that can be analyzed in terms of network architecture and network rules.<br />
The rules defining roles such as users, verifiers and issuers can be found in the governance of most currencies, be they traditionnal "fiat" or new "crypto".<br />
For example, in the rules governing the dollar network, issuers are defined as the privileged holders of a full-fledged banking licence.<br />
If any trait should caracterize Bitcoin vs a traditionnal currency, then "decentralized currency" or "peer-reviewed currency" describes it more precisely.<br />
With respect to decentralization, There is no such thing as a fully decentralized currency and there is no example of a fully centralized currency either.<br />
The dollar and bitcoin sit at the opposite ends of this spectrum but even the dollar offers a certain level of autonomy to the users through paper bank notes and metal coins.<br />
These paper and metal tokens are centrally issued and centrally verifiable but between issuance and occasionnal verifications they can travel from hands to hands without intermediary.<br />
Thus it could be argued that the functionning of the dollar network is partially decentralized.<br />
Bitcoin is clearly positionned on the "decentralized" extreme siding with its younger cousin Litecoin but most alt-coins sit in between them and the dollar, with users sometimes unaware or in denial of their centralized features.<br />
Let's take for example a very common alternative to Bitcoin PoW consensus building mechanism, namely PoS.<br />
In fact, PoS coins are indeed very similar to central bank money except that the PoS coin central bankers are the founders and the coin holders.<br />
These new, self-appointed "central" bankers put their money where their mouth is, unlike their traditionnal, co-opted counterparts at the Fed or at the ECB.<br />
Put simply, a PoS network assumes that the coin holders will upvote (sign) legit transaction blocks because they have a stake in the sustained value of the coins.<br />
Unfortunately, most coin holders will not vote because they are precisely just that, coinholders, and lack the desire, if not the incentive, to participate more actively in the ongoing network transaction validation process.<br />
This obvious hole in the game theory analysis of PoS leaves PoS coins at the mercy of a small minority of coinholders with sufficient incentives to disrupt the PoS network.<br />
The rogue coin holders coud be for instance founders of a competing payment network.<br />
Many alt-coins promoters, including some cryptographers, turn out to be greedy, short-sighted, self-proclaimed and recently self-taught network consensus "expert" or "thought leaders".<br />
Caveat emptor.</p>
