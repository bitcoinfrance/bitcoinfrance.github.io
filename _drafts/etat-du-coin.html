<p>The current monetary base of the Bitcoin market stands at around $1 billion USD. The monetary base of the US Dollar market is $3 trillion USD, a difference of 299,900%. Clearly, Bitcoin has a very long way to go to become a significant player in the currency market.</p>
<p>Add this to the $150,000 a day bitcoin miners are collectively spending on electricity to produce about half a million dollars worth of bitcoin, and the scale of the computing resources currently devoted to producing the virtual currency really comes into perspective.</p>
