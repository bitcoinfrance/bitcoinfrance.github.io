<p>Fabian proposed a “Reversible ICO” (RICO), a model which would allow the investors to redeem their investment via a smart contract. According to the developer, this would reduce the risk of scammed ICOs & increase the comfort factor for the investors knowing well that they can get their investment back at any time during the project cycle. This would also incentivize the project teams to comply with their promises. If the projects don’t work out they would follow the path of “failing naturally” without investors losing their money. The returned tokens could always be bought over by other interested investors. However, this path would make funding amounts less stable & other avenues of private funding would be needed outside the public token sale to smoothly run the project.
Vogelsteller intends to test out this new concept with the launch of new fashion design blockchain startup Lukso for which no time frame has been announced yet. Earlier this year, Vitalik Buterin had also proposed an alternative funding model called Decentralized Autonomous ICO (DAICO), which allows slow disbursement or even reimbursement of funds in case of ICO not meeting the expectation of investors. On a side note, Vogelsteller and his team of developers have proposed a new security token standard based on Ethereum network called ERC-1400, which would help businesses organize Security Token Offerings (STOs) while complying with regulations.</p>

<p>But wait, how can three top cryptocurrency exchanges (among an easy hundred) be worth $20 billion if the entire market of the assets they service is only worth $110 Billion?
To put this in perspective, let’s look at conventional equity markets. The total value of all stocks in the world is around $70 trillion. The NYSE accounts for about $21.3 trillion of this capitalization, and ICE (the parent company of the NYSE) is valued at $44 billion.
ICE is worth twice as much as three top cryptocurrency exchanges, but the market of assets it addresses is worth 200 times the market cap of all cryptocurrencies.</p>
